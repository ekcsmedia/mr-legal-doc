  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Mr Legal (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the mobile application <strong>Mr Legal - Advocate</strong> (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and safeguard information when you use the App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect two categories of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> we do not require you to create an account to use the App. If you choose to provide contact details (for example, to contact support), we will store that information only to respond to your request.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically collected information:</strong> when you use the App we may collect technical data such as device model, operating system version, crash and diagnostics information, and usage analytics to help us improve the App.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Permissions the App requests</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions from your device (only if a feature in the App requires them):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Access to your device’s location is requested only if you use features that require location (for example to find nearby advocates). Location data is used solely to provide that feature and is not sold to third parties.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet access:</strong> The App requires network access to communicate with our servers, fetch data, and provide online features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will always request permission from you via the operating system before accessing any protected data. You can revoke permissions at any time through your device settings; revoking certain permissions may disable related features.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How we use the information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate App features (for example: mapping, search results, and messaging where applicable).</li>
      <li>Improve, maintain, and analyze App performance and user experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to user support requests sent to <a href="mailto:mrlegalprime@gmail.com">mrlegalprime@gmail.com</a>.</li>
      <li>Detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents and abuse.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With service providers who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, crash reporting). These providers are contractually restricted from using your data for other purposes.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations or to respond to lawful requests from public authorities.</li>
      <li>When we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, safety, or property, or that of our users or others.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Storage and retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the App and for legitimate business purposes (for example to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements). If you ask us to delete your personal data we will take reasonable steps to do so, subject to applicable law and any contractual obligations.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is completely secure. If you believe your information has been compromised, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:mrlegalprime@gmail.com">mrlegalprime@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services (for example, analytics, crash reporting, hosting and other backend services). These third-party services have their own privacy policies and may collect, store, and process data. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those services if you want details about how they use data.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is <strong>not intended for children under the age of 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:mrlegalprime@gmail.com">mrlegalprime@gmail.com</a> and we will remove the information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>User rights and choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data, and to object to or restrict certain processing. To exercise these rights or if you have questions about your data, contact us at <a href="mailto:mrlegalprime@gmail.com">mrlegalprime@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Data collected by the App may be transferred and processed in countries other than your own. When we transfer data internationally we take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the App after a change constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
